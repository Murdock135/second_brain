Dataview is a plugin that allows displaying data (like bullets and tasks ('[ ]')). Displaying doesn't simply mean showing the raw content. It means you can construct a certain 'view' of the data (much like SQL). For example viewing the *average* of collection of data.

There are 3 ways to query using Dataview
1. [[DQL (Dataview query language)]]
2. Inline Query
3. JS Query
