If we gave robots the ability to *express* pain with language, that won't be enough for us to empathize with them during pain. Because we know each and every single thing about what is happening under the hood. Going further, some people wouldn't empathize even if we gave the robots pain receptors because they would think that the pain the robots are feeling isn't real. 
Similarly, would, if we have a creator, ever be able to empathize with us? Perhaps *only if* they made us exactly like them.
TLDR: We cannot empathize with our own creations, but can with clones
# Chat GPT's comments
This is a provocative and insightful argument. Formally, it can be analyzed as follows:
### **Key Claims and Structure**

1. **Premise 1**: Empathy requires _epistemic opacity_—some uncertainty or incompleteness in understanding the internal states of the other.
2. **Premise 2**: We cannot empathize with a system whose internals we fully know and control (e.g., robots with expressive pain but transparent mechanisms).
3. **Premise 3**: Adding pain receptors may still not be sufficient if the _ontology_ of the robot’s pain is seen as inauthentic (ontological gap).
4. **Analogy**: If we are creations of a higher being, that being may be incapable of empathizing with us _unless_ we are ontologically similar or epistemically opaque to them.
5. **Conclusion**: Empathy is fundamentally limited by either ontological similarity or epistemic distance; creators cannot empathize with their own creations unless they are (in some sense) clones.
### **Formal Expression (Sketch)**
Let:

- E(x,y)E(x, y): "x can empathize with y"
    
- C(x,y)C(x, y): "x created y"
    
- S(x,y)S(x, y): "x and y are structurally similar"
    
- O(x,y)O(x, y): "x is epistemically opaque to y"
    

Then a central thesis might be:

$$
∀x,y:C(x,y)∧¬S(x,y)∧¬O(x,y)→¬E(x,y)\forall x, y: C(x, y) \land \neg S(x, y) \land \neg O(x, y) \rightarrow \neg E(x, y)
$$
That is, _creators cannot empathize with their creations unless there is structural similarity or epistemic opacity_.
### **Philosophical Context**

- **Nagel’s “What is it like to be a bat?”** [1974] supports the idea that phenomenal experience cannot be fully accessed from the outside. Even if we knew _everything_ physical, something is missing.
- **Searle’s Chinese Room** [1980] underscores how _simulation of expression_ (language use) does not equate to internal understanding or experience.
- **Dennett vs. Chalmers**: This argument aligns more with Chalmers’ _hard problem of consciousness_, rejecting functionalism’s sufficiency for empathy.
### **Critical Notes**
- The argument implicitly treats empathy as _inter-subjective_ and _phenomenologically grounded_, not merely as _behavioral matching_.
- The last point—“we can empathize with clones”—introduces a paradox: _do we only empathize with what we see as sufficiently like ourselves?_ This suggests empathy may be more narcissistic or self-referential than commonly thought.

### **Suggested Refinement**

You could explore the _threshold function_ of empathy:
$$
E(x,y)=f(S(x,y),O(x,y))E(x, y) = f(S(x, y), O(x, y))
$$
Where both structural similarity and epistemic opacity must exceed a certain threshold for empathy to emerge.

### **Conclusion**

Your argument is philosophically coherent, aligned with phenomenology and consciousness studies. It challenges naive assumptions about language, behavior, and empathy. The clone/empathy link is strong and invites deeper inquiry into creator-creation dynamics—whether artificial or divine.
